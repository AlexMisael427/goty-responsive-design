      "description":"The story is set in the 31st century, in a world where humans live in scattered tribal-like populations with limited access to technology. Their technologically advanced predecessors are remembered as the 'Old Ones'. Large robotic creatures, known as 'machines', dominate the Earth. For the most part, they peacefully coexist with humans, who occasionally hunt them for parts. However, a phenomenon known as the 'Derangement' has caused machines to become more aggressive towards humans, and larger and deadlier machines have begun to appear. There are four tribes that are prominently featured: the Nora, the Carja, the Banuk, and the Oseram. The Nora are fierce hunter-gatherers who live in the mountains and worship nature as the 'All-Mother'. The Carja are desert-dwelling city builders who worship the Sun. The Banuk consists of hunters and shamans who live in snowy mountains and adore the machines. The Oseram are tinkerers known for their metalworking, brewing, and arguing.",

Alongside Rafe, the Drake brothers infiltrate a Panamanian jail to access the former cell of Avery's first mate, where Nate discovers a hollow St. Dismas idol.
